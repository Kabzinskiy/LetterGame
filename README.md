# LetterGame
LetterGame is a test task.
Task: implement an application using Unity/C# to generate a mesh from
random letters and their mixing. Consider the application
designed for vertical mobile phone screen. At
development should use only standard Unity tools without
third party plugins.
In this case, shuffling is changing the current position of each
letters to a new random position in the grid. After mixing in
one cell can have only one letter, i.e. a few letters
must occupy the same position. Position change is animated
moving a letter to a new position in 2 seconds.

Availability of additional features:
1. The size of the letters changes depending on their number in the grid. In a 3x3 grid the letters are large, in a 12x12 grid they are small.
2. Any interesting features in your opinion.
